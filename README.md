## Server
### Setup
Run server using ./IRCServer in terminal. 

Server will ask you for ip address and port to use (default: 127.0.0.1 6667).
If you want to setup your server on another ip address or port just write the
ip address and port when asked (after setup ip address and port cannot be changed).

### Basic Commands
* -q => shutdown server (will also logoff all users, clear data and end all threads).
* -u => prints all users that are currently connected to the server.
* -r => prints all currently existing rooms.
* -ur <room name> => prints all users in <room name> room.
* -k <user name> => kicks user <user name> from the room in which he is.
* -b <user name> => kicks user <user name> from server.
